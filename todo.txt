BACKLOG
---------
- page allocator: implement free list so pages can recycle
- page allocator/slab allocator: implement reserve function so n numbers of pages can be allocated at a time. this would replace passing num_pages into these up front and makes the interface (perhaps) more consistent with other mechanisms in the library.
- buf: create a Buffer_Concept and rework buf to be based on it
- buf: pretty formatting for source errors
- term: module for ANSI output to terminals
- filesys: implement glob function, which will also touch the init and fini functions for the
            filesys module.
- filesys: need to open and read the xdg config file (if found) and put into a symtab_t or hashtab_t.
            also, need to read applicable env vars once at module init and put them into the
            same symtab_t/hashtab_t.
- filesys: once meta data is done (previous task), implement the remaining places::* functions
- rework graphviz api
- add directed_graph_t
- locale: localized strings
- libgfx: create new library holding common graphics related functionality

--------
    DONE
    ----
    - path: implement replace_extension function
    - path: implement stem function, which returns the file name without the extension

--------
    DONE
    ----
    - add bintree_t
    - memory: create a public api which returns a tree structure of allocators that tools like a UI can
            invoke and create a display of allocators in a hierarchy

--------
    DONE
    ----
    - add queue_t
    - audit: stack_t
    - fix: set_t functionality finalized & tested
    - fix: symtab_t appears to be increasing the size member more often than it should so the count of
            a symtab_t is off-by-n (where n is usually <= 5) compared to a hashtab_t.

20201505
--------
    DONE
    ----
    - fix: symtab_t remove needs to be rewritten to recursively visit each prefix

20201405

    - add set_t
    - add linked_list_t
    - integrate iterator macros

--------
    DONE
    ----
    - replace intern pool + hashtable in proxy_system
    - implement symtab::find and symtab::remove
    - test a few different slab size configs
    - change slab system to allow config for number of pages allocated for
        each slab.  default should be 1 page.
    - change stable_array and symtab to support passing in number of pages
        default is 1 page.

--------
    DONE
    ----
    - slab::reset function
    - symtab::reset should mark all nodes empty, free values
