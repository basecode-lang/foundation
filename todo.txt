BACKLOG
---------
- add nice error formatting for source buffers
- filesys: implement glob function, which will also touch the init and fini functions for the
            filesys module.
- filesys: need to open and read the xdg config file (if found) and put into a symtab_t or hashtab_t.
            also, need to read applicable env vars once at module init and put them into the
            same symtab_t/hashtab_t.
- filesys: once meta data is done (previous task), implement the remaining places::* functions
- path: implement replace_extension function
- path: implement stem function, which returns the file name without the extension
- path: implement replace_filename function

    ----
    - add queue_t
    - audit: stack_t
    - fix: set_t functionality finalized & tested
    - fix: symtab_t appears to be increasing the size member more often than it should so the count of
            a symtab_t is off-by-n (where n is usually <= 5) compared to a hashtab_t.
